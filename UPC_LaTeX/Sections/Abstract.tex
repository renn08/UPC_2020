In this article, we estimate the maximum windspeed that allows the quadcopter to stay within 20cm from the target. We use python to build a physical simulation system, a thrust control system that can control the quadcopter to react to the wind and maintain its stability and a wind simulator . By inputting  two basic patterns of wind(periodic and noise) into our simulation with different magnitude, we get the average time that the quadcopter is able to stay within range. We find that periodic wind poses greater threats to safety operation than the dominant wind with noise.
